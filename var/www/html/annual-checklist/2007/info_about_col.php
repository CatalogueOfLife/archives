<tr> <td> <p class="fieldheader">The Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of 
Life</p><p>The Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life is planned to become 
a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth by 
the year 2011. Rapid progress has been made recently and this, the seventh 
edition of the Annual Checklist, contains <?php echo "<b>$accepted_species_names</b>" ; ?> 
species. Please note that this is probably just more than half of the world's 
known species. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient.</p><p>The 
present Catalogue is compiled with sectors provided by 47 taxonomic databases 
from around the world. Many of these contain taxonomic data and opinions 
from extensive networks of specialists, so that the complete work contains 
contributions from more than 3,000 specialists from throughout the taxonomic 
profession. Species 2000 and ITIS teams peer review databases, select appropriate 
sectors and integrate the sectors into a single coherent catalogue with 
a single hierarchical classification. It is planned to introduce alternative 
taxonomic treatments and alternative classifications, but an important feature 
is that for those users who wish to use it, a single preferred catalogue, 
based on peer reviews, will continue to be provided.</p><p>The Catalogue 
is published as two products:</p><p>&#149; <b>Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue 
of Life: 2007 Annual Checklist</b><br> The Annual Checklist is published 
each year as a fixed edition that can be cited and used as a common catalogue 
for comparative purposes by many organisations. A copy is on the CD-ROM, 
which is distributed free of charge, and an identical copy is on the website 
at <a href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2007/" target="_blank">http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2007/</a>. 
Archived earlier editions are also available on the website.</p><p>&#149; 
<b>Species 2000 &amp; ITIS Catalogue of Life: Dynamic Checklist</b><br> 
The Dynamic Checklist is a virtual catalogue operated on the Internet and 
available both for users and as an electronic web-service at www.catalogueoflife.org. 
The Dynamic Checklist harvests taxonomic sectors and associated strands 
of hierarchical classification dynamically from the source databases across 
the internet. The Dynamic Checklist is presently less extensive than the 
Annual Checklist because fewer taxonomic sectors have been connected so 
far. </p><p>It differs in concept from the Annual Checklist in that:<br> 
(i) the taxonomic records may be updated and the catalogue changed more 
frequently than in the Annual Checklist and (ii) the Dynamic Checklist contains 
additional regional species checklists (such as the Regional Checklist - 
Europe, effectively a Pan-European Species Checklist) not included in the 
Annual Checklist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="fieldheader">The Catalogue of Life 
partnership</p><p>In June 2001 the Species 2000 and ITIS organisations decided 
to work together to create the Catalogue of Life. They declared a target 
for completing coverage for all 1.75 million known species by 2011. The 
two organisations remain separate and different in structure. However, by 
working together in creating a common product, the partnership has enabled 
them to reduce duplication of effort, make better use of resources, and 
to accelerate production. The combined Annual Checklist on CD-ROM has become 
well established as a cited reference used for data compilation and comparison. 
For instance, it is used as the principal taxonomic index in the GBIF data 
portal and recognised by the CBD. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="fieldheader">About 
ITIS</p><p><a href="http://www.itis.gov/" target="_blank" title="ITIS"><img src="images/ITIS.gif" width="161" height="80" vspace="20" align="right" hspace="20" lowsrc="10" border="0"></a>The 
Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) is a partnership of federal 
agencies and other organisations from the United States, Canada, and Mexico, 
with data stewards and experts from around the world (see <a href="http://www.itis.gov/" target="_blank" title="ITIS">http://www.itis.gov</a>). 
The ITIS database is an automated reference of scientific and common names 
of biota of interest to North America. It contains more than 535,000 names 
for species in all kingdoms, and is accessible via the World Wide Web in 
English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese (<a href="http://itis.gbif.net" target="_blank" title="ITIS">http://itis.gbif.net</a>). 
ITIS is part of the US National Biological Information Infrastructure (<a href="http://www.nbii.gov/" target="_blank" title="NBII">http://www.nbii.gov</a>) 
and an associate member of GBIF.<br> ITIS is managed by Michael Ruggiero 
(Director), Thomas Orrell (Deputy Director), David Nicolson (Data Development 
Leader), Ray Carlino (Information Technology Leader), Roy McDiarmid (Taxonomy 
Leader), Guy Baillargeon (ITIS-Canada Director), and Patricia Koleff (SIIT-Mexico 
Director). They are advised and supported by the ITIS Steering Committee 
and ITIS Data Stewards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="fieldheader">About Species 2000 
</p><p><a href="http://www.sp2000.org" target="_blank" title="Species 2000"><img src="images/sp2000_small.gif" width="142" height="62" vspace="20" align="right" hspace="20" lowsrc="10" border="0"></a>Species 
2000 (<a href="http://www.sp2000.org/" target="_blank" title="Species 2000">http://www.sp2000.org</a>) 
is an autonomous federation of taxonomic database custodians, involving 
taxonomists throughout the world. Its goal is to collate a uniform and validated 
index to the world's known species. It is a not-for-profit company limited 
by guarantee (registered in England No. 3479405) with six directors and 
taxonomic database organisations from around the world as members. It is 
sponsored by CODATA, IUBS and IUMS; is an associate participant in GBIF; 
and is recognised by UNEP and the CBD. There are two regional programmes: 
Species 2000 europa (<a href="http://www.sp2000europa.org" target="_blank">http://www.sp2000europa.org</a>), 
funded by the European Commission, working with global and regional databases 
based in Europe and Species 2000 Asia-Oceania (<a href="http://www.sp2000asiaoceania.org" target="_blank">www.sp2000asiaoceania.org</a>) 
working to promote taxonomy and taxonomic databasing in that region. The 
Phase II Programme is establising a number of regional/national hubs of 
which the European Hub, the Species 2000 China Node (<a href="http://www.sp2000.cn" target="_blank">http://www.sp2000.cn</a>), 
and the N America Hub are the first to appear.</p><p>The Species 2000 scientific 
programme is led by its Team: Guy Baillargeon (Canada), Frank A Bisby (UK), 
Marc Brugman (Netherlands), Jerry Cooper (New Zealand), Dennis Gordon (New 
Zealand), Luciane Marinoni (Brazil), Michael A Ruggiero (USA), Vishwas Chavan 
(India), Junko Shimura (Japan), Edward Vanden Berghe (Belgium), Richard 
J White (UK), Karen L Wilson (Australia), with further assistance from the 
Species 2000 europa Steering Group, the Species 2000 Asia-Oceania Group 
and the Species 2000 China Node.</p><p><img src="images/blank.gif" width="510" height="1" border="0"></p></td></tr>
